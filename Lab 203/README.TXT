Turtle example classes for CCPS 209 Computer Science II, taught by Ilkka Kokkarinen
for the Chang School of Continuing Education, Ryerson University.

Edited and updated countless times since 2002. Should be pretty good by now.

Feel free to use any of these in your own teaching, giving me appropriate credit.
